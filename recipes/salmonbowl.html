		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		This is an easy meal to put together because it incorporates cooking on a sheet pan. If you are starting with fresh salmon you must adjust the cooking times.
		</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
                <li>½ cup brown rice, rinsed well</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
                <li>2 (4 ounce) frozen salmon fillets with skin</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped toasted pecans</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring chicken broth and butter to a boil in a saucepan. Add rinsed brown rice and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. When finished, remove from the heat, cover, and keep warm. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
            <li>When the rice has about 30 minutes left, combine green beans, sweet potato, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl; toss to combine. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, separating green beans on one side and sweet potatoes on the other. </li>
            <li>Combine honey, chipotle pepper, and garlic in a bowl; season to taste with salt and pepper. Brush mixture onto frozen salmon and place on top of the green beans, skin-side down (this step is important.) </li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are soft and salmon flakes easily with a fork, 30 to 35 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven. Divide rice between 2 bowls. Top each bowl with vegetables and a salmon fillet. Sprinkle toasted pecans over top. </li>
        </ul> 
        </div>
